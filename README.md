The Rust guessing game is a number guessing game that you can play on your terminal. It was built using Rust, and you can find the project in the

Rust book --> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html. 

The game is compatible with both MacOS and Windows, and all you need to do is double-click on the file to start playing. The range of numbers you need to guess is between 1 and 100. I had a lot of fun creating this game, and I hope you find it enjoyable. Who knows, maybe playing it will inspire you to learn Rust as well.
