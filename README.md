A rust guessing game
This is a number guessing game that runs in you're terminal if you couldn't tell already it was built with rust.
The guessing game came from the rust book 
--> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html
Don't know why I posted this to GitHub but I did, anyways had a lot of fun doing this and hope if you find this cool that you'll pick up rust as well.
